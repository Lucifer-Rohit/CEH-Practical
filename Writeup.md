## My Journey :nerd_face:

I have studying about cybersecurity for the past 3 years. I have heard about this certification quite a few times during these years. Later I cam to know of a scholarship program that is being offer by the EC-Council in the end of 2021.<br />
Apperently EC-Council has announced $1M for C|EH Practical certification for the enhancment of the hacking skills in the cybersecurity community.  The actual cost of this certification is 550$, but if the candidate gets selected by this program, they would get the same certification for just 99$ (which is a very generous offer). The scholarship application has a few pre-requisites and the candidate is asked to write a breif answer for why the deserve the scholarship. That is pretty much the scholarship application.<br />

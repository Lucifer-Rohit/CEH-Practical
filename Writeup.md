## My Journey :nerd_face:

I have studying about cybersecurity for the past 3 years. I have heard about this certification quite a few times during these years. Later I cam to know of a scholarship program that is being offer by the EC-Council in the end of 2021.<br />
Apperently EC-Council has announced 1M USD for C|EH Practical certification for the enhancment of the hacking skills in the cybersecurity community.  The actual cost of this certification is 550USD, but if the candidate gets selected by this program, they would get the same certification for just 99USD (which is a very generous offer). The scholarship application has a few pre-requisites and the candidate is asked to write a breif answer for why the deserve the scholarship. That is pretty much the scholarship application. To know more about the scholarship visit the [link](https://www.eccouncil.org/ec-council-announces-1m-ceh-practical-scholarship-2021-to-boost-ethical-hacking-skill/).<br />

Fortunately, I got selected by the scholarship program in Nov 2021. After the payment of the scholarship amount, they sent a coupoun code to access the certification exam along with the list of instruction to follow. At the end of the procedure, I was able to schedule the exam as per the slot system availabe in the aspen portal, which is where the exam would take place.<br />

**Note:** The coupon code is valid for 365 days to use it in the aspen portal. And after using the coupoun in the portal, the candidate can schedule the exam within 365 days. So they have a total of 2 years to attend the certification exam.<br />

Well, I redemmed the coupoun right after I got it :upside_down_face:.
